Deep learning is a subfield of machine learning that uses large neural networks with many layers (deep networks) to automatically learn patterns from large amounts of data.

Itâ€™s especially powerful for tasks like image recognition, natural language processing, and speech understanding where traditional methods struggle.

How It Works:
a. Neural Networks: Modeled loosely after the human brain, made up of neurons (small computing units).

b. Layers: Deep learning networks have multiple layers:

c. Input layer takes in data (e.g., pixels of an image)

d. Hidden layers extract features (e.g., edges, textures, shapes)

e. Output layer gives the result (e.g., "This is a cat")

f. Training: The model learns by adjusting internal connections (called weights) to reduce errors on the training data using backpropagation and gradient descent.
